/**
 * This class provides the robot with the moves it can make and the
 * elements it can set and retrieve. UnreliableRobot does not make
 * the robot move, but it has the basic methods that can be called through
 * WallFollower.java to make the robot move forwards, change the direction it is
 * facing, change the battery level when the robot completes an
 * action, check to see if the robot is in a room or at an exit,
 * check to see the distance between the robot and an
 * obstacle, start the robot's failure and repair process,
 * along with some other actions. This class also
 * tells the user if the robot has stopped, either because it ran
 * into an obstacle or it ran out of energy.
