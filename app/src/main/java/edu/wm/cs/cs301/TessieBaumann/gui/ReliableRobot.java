/**
 * This class provides the robot with the moves it can make and the
 * elements it can set and retrieve. ReliableRobot does not make
 * the robot move, but it has the basic methods that can be called through
 * Wizard.java to make the robot move forwards, change the direction it is
 * facing, change the battery level when the robot completes an
 * action, check to see if the robot is in a room or at an exit,
 * checks to see the distance between the robot and an
 * obstacle, along with some other actions. This class also
 * tells the user if the robot has stopped, either because it ran
 * into an obstacle or it ran out of energy.
